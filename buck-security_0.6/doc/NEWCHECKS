# How to add new checks to buck-security? #
###########################################
Version 0.4

# General
You can write new checks either using bash one liners, or for more complex
checks use perl.

# BASH
Use the file CHECK-BASH_TEMPLATE.pm in the checks directory as a template.
Just add the name, title, the whitelist-filename and the bash code to the file and save it under the
chosen file. All necessary items which needed to be replaced are marked with
an TODO_
Then create a whitelistfile with the name chosen and add the check to
conf/buck.conf

# Perl
Use the file CHECK-PERL_TEMPLATE.pm in the checks directory as a template.
Add title, packagename and name of the whitelist file. All necessary items
which needed to be replaced are marked with an TODO_

Add your Perl code between CODE START and CODE END at the bottom of the file.
Your code has to save a list of the results (f.e. file or directory names,
package names, ...) in an array named @outcomes. This array will be returned
to the program automatically.
